# voronoiArt
CPSC 312 project

Given an input image, and the number of voronoi partitions to create, we will implement a flood fill algorithm starting from a randomly generated set of center coordinates in the image to create the specified number of partitions in the image, resulting in interesting artistic results where every pixel in a given voronoi partition have the same color.
